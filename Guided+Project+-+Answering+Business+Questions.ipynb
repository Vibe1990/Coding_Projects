    "                 invoice_line AS il\n",

    "             INNER JOIN \n",
    "                 customer AS c ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id)\n",
    "                \n",
    "5) Looking at the example provided, the conditions will need to make it so that WHEN number of customer (i.e. COUNT(customer_id)) equals ONE, then country = \"Other\", ELSE country = country\n",
    "\n",
    "        CASE \n",

    "            ELSE  c.country \n",
    "        END AS \"country\"\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Together, the WITH Clause looks like the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "        WITH country_or_other AS\n",
    "            (SELECT\n",
    "                 CASE \n",
    "                    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) \n",
    "                          FROM customer \n",
    "                          WHERE country = c.country) = 1 THEN \"Other\"\n",
    "                    ELSE  c.country \n",
    "                 END AS \"country\",\n",
    "                 c.customer_id,\n",
    "                 il.*\n",
    "             FROM \n",
    "                 invoice_line AS il\n",
    "             INNER JOIN \n",
    "                 invoice AS i ON i.invoice_id = il.invoice_id\n",
    "             INNER JOIN \n",
    "                 customer AS c ON c.customer_id = i.customer_id)\n",
    "                \n",
    "7) Looking to create a main subquery, we need the following columns\n",
    "\n",
    "        - name of country (likely refer to subquery)\n",
    "        - number of customer per country\n",
    "        - total sales amount per country \n",
    "        - avg total sale amount per customer\n",
    "        - avg total sale amount per invoice\n",
    "      \n",
    "    So it should look like the following:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        SELECT  country,\n",
    "                num_of_customer(s),\n",
    "                total_sales,\n",
    "                avg_sale_per_customer,\n",
    "                avg_sale_per_invoice\n",
    "        FROM ???\n",
    "        GROUP BY 1\n",
    "        ORDER BY 1 ASC, 2 DESC\n",
    "\n",
    "8) In order to calculate total sales per given customer, we will need a summarized table that contains (a) name of country, (b) sales info. Using our WITH clause subquery, we can formulate another subquery:\n",
    "\n",
    "        (SELECT country, \n",
    "                COUNT(customer_id),\n",
    "                SUM(unit_price) AS 'total_sales',\n",
    "                CAST(SUM(unit_price) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(customer_id) AS \"avg_sale_per_customer\",\n",
    "                CAST(SUM(unit_price) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(invoice_id) AS \"avg_sale_per_invoice\"\n",
    "          FROM country_or_other)\n",
    "          \n",
    "9) Currently with the above set-up, we will end up getting just a single value due to GROUP BY refers to the main query's SELECT and not of the subquery. Thus need to modify it by inclusing the ORDER BY and GROUP BY options in the subquery.  \n",
    "         \n",
    "         (SELECT country,\n",
    "                 COUNT(customer_id),\n",
    "                 SUM(unit_price) AS 'total_sales',\n",
    "                 CAST(SUM(unit_price) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(customer_id) AS \"avg_sale_per_customer\",\n",
    "                 CAST(SUM(unit_price) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(invoice_id) AS \"avg_sale_per_invoice\"\n",
    "          FROM country_or_other\n",
    "          GROUP BY 1\n",
    "          ORDER BY 2 DESC)\n",
    "        \n",
    "10) In running this set up, we run into a few problems. Firstly, we end up getting hundreds-to-thousands of customers. Furthermore in the last two columns gives us the average unit sale of each item as opposed to per customer or per invoice. Knowing that the \"Other\" column should have been made up of only 1 customer from the various countries (which is a total of 195), it is likely a result of the same customer within these countries being counted multiple times. Thus we need a way to only include entries for a customer as one entry for that country. This is solved by using the DISTINCT statement. \n",
    "\n",
    "            (SELECT country,\n",
    "                 COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id),\n",
    "                 ROUND(SUM(unit_price), 2) AS 'total_sales',\n",
    "                 ROUND(CAST(SUM(unit_price) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id), 2) AS \"avg_sale_per_customer\",\n",
    "                 ROUND(CAST(SUM(unit_price) AS FLOAT) / COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_id), 2) AS \"avg_sale_per_invoice\"\n",
    "          FROM country_or_other\n",
    "          GROUP BY 1\n",
    "          ORDER BY 2 DESC)\n",
    "          \n",
    "11) Lastly, we need a way to make it so that the order of the COUNTRY should include the \"Other\" group at the bottom of the list despite is lexiographic order. Using the example provided, it looks like we need to include a logic of sorts to state then WHEN the name of the country is \"Other\" we assign it a value of 1 whilst the rest is assigned a value of 0 and assign this as a column of sorts. Then use this column as part of the ORDER BY statement. \n",

    "The purpose of this project is to aim at creating a guestimate of the chances of winning this lottery based on historical data.  Here we want to be able to build functions that enable the user to answer questions like: \n",

    "1) What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",

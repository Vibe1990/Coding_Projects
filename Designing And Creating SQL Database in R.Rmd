# INTRODUCTION 

In this project, I will be working with data comprised of games from [Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball) as compiled by the non-profit organization [Retrosheet](https://www.retrosheet.org/).  Specifically, it collected info from the 1800s to today.  There are 4 major data sets which will be used in creating this database:

* [game_log.csv](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/376/game_log.csv)
* [park_codes.csv](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/376/park_codes.csv)
* [person_codes.csv](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/376/person_codes.csv)
* [team_codes.csv](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/376/team_codes.csv)


# STEP 1: Loading Libraries and Loading Data

NOTE: when loading the game_log file, some of the columns aren't being read correctly as a 'character' type. So certain columns need to be represented corrected as such.  This can be [referenced here](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html). 

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)
library(dbplyr)

setwd("~/MyDatasets")

game.log = read_csv("game_log.csv", 
                    col_types = cols(.default = "c",
                                     v_league = "c", h_league = "c",
                                     `3b_umpire_id` = "c", `3b_umpire_name` = "c",
                                     `2b_umpire_id` = "c", `2b_umpire_name` = "c",
                                     `lf_umpire_id` = "c", `lf_umpire_name` = "c",
                                     `rf_umpire_id` = "c", `rf_umpire_name` = "c",
                                     completion = "c", winning_rbi_batter_id = "c",
                                     winning_rbi_batter_id_name = "c", protest = "c",
                                     v_first_catcher_interference = "c", 
                                     h_first_catcher_interference = "c"))


park.codes = read.csv("park_codes.csv")

person.codes = read.csv("person_codes.csv")

team.codes = read.csv("team_codes.csv")


```

## Looking at Game Log Data Set 

```{r}

dim(game.log)

```

There are over 170,000 + games that were recorded from 1871 to 2016.  Each of these entries have the following entries: 

* General information pertaining to the game 
* Team statistics for both the home and visiting team 
* A list of information of all the players, managers, coach and umpires

Here is a link to a [text file](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/376/game_log_fields.txt) that goes into detail of all the information of the entries in this data set. 

Within the game log, each player has a defensive position listed, b/t the numbers 1-10. Based on the reference [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_positions#:~:text=There%20are%20nine%20fielding%20positions,and%209%20(right%20fielder).), the breakdown of the numbering works as the following: 

| ** NUMBER **   | ** POSITION **       |
|----------------|----------------------|
|       1        | Pitcher              |
|       2        | Catcher              |
|       3        | 1st Baseman          |
|       4        | 2nd Baseman          |
|       5        | 3rd Baseman          |
|       6        | Shortstop            |
|       7        | Left Fielder         |
|       8        | Center Fielder       |
|       9        | Right Fielder        |
|      10        | Designated Hitter    | 

Prior to the formalized MLB that we know today, which comprises of the American League (AL) and the National League (NL), there were several other leagues that had existed prior that have since gone defunct.  These leagues included:

* AA = American Association
* FL = Federal League
* PL = Players League
* UA = Union Association


```{r}

dim(person.codes)
```
With the person_codes data set, it encompasses data pertaining to all of the personnel (over 20,000 of them) that had been involved in any of those 170,000 + games.  The information that this data set contains are:

| ** Variable ** | ** Description **                        |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| id             | identifier of the person                 |
| last           | last name of the person                  |
| first          | first name of the person                 |
| player_debut   | date when the person debut as a player   |
| mgr_debut      | date when the person debut as a manager  |
| coach_debut    | date when the person debut as a coach    |
| ump_debut      | date when the person debut as an umpire  | 



```{r}

head(park.codes)

```

This is a data set pertaining to information about the park.  Some entries for this data set includes: 

| **VARIABLE**           | **DESCRIPTION**                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| park_id                | Identifier for the park                          |
| name                   | Name of the park                                 |
| aka                    | Alternate name for the park                      |
| city                   | Name of the city where the park is located       |
| state                  | State where the park is located                  |
| start                  | Start date when the park was used to host team   |
| end                    | End date when the park was used to host team     |
| league                 | The league that the team was associated with     |
| notes                  | Additional notes pertaining to the park          | 

```{r}

head(team.codes)

```

This is a data set pertaining to information about the team.  Some entries for this data set includes: 

| **VARIABLE**           | **DESCRIPTION**                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| team_id                | Identifier of the specific baseball team         |
| league                 | The name of the league that the team belongs to  |
| start                  | Start date when the team was in existence        |
| end                    | Last date when the team was in existence         |
| city                   | City where the team was hosted                   |
| nickname               | Alternate name for the team                      |
| franch_id              | Identifier for the franchise                     |
| notes                  | Additional notes about the team                  | 


# STEP 2: Importing Data into SQLite

```{r}

conn = dbConnect(SQLite(), 'mlb.db')

dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = 'game_log', 
             value = game.log, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = 'park_codes', 
             value =  park.codes, row.names =  FALSE, header = TRUE)

dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = "person_codes", 
             value = person.codes, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = "team_codes", 
             value = team.codes, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

dbListTables(conn)

```

Now that the first step was to create the necessary tables within the database (entitled "mlb.db"), we will also need to do a bit of modification with creating a new column in the game_log table called "**game_id**". This game_id is made up of three parts: (1) date, (2) h_name (i.e. home team name) and (3) number_of_game as to indicate the number of game that is played that day with 0 =  single game, 1 = 1st of a double-header and 2 = 2nd of a double-header.

```{r}

alter_game_log_command = "ALTER TABLE game_log ADD COLUMN game_id TEXT;"

dbExecute(conn, alter_game_log_command)

dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM game_log LIMIT 2;") # Check to see if the column is actually found in game_log

updating_game_log_command = "
  UPDATE game_log
  SET game_id = date || h_name || number_of_game
  WHERE game_id IS NULL;
"
dbExecute(conn, updating_game_log_command)

dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT game_id, date, h_name, number_of_game FROM game_log LIMIT 5;") # A check to see if game_id is properly set 

```

# STEP 3: Looking for normalization opportunities

In looking for opportunities to be able to reduce the redundancy and improve the integrity of the data, there are several ways that this could be accomplished with this data: 

* It is possible to reproduce the debut dates of players from the person_codes using the data from game_log. 
* Start, end and sequence columns in team_codes can also be reproduced via game_log
* start & end years within park_codes can be reproduced via game_log 
* As there are a number of cases where ID + player name are found in game_log, we can instead remove them and use the name data found within person_codes
* In game_log the offensive + defensive stats are repeated. It is possible that we can break these out and have a table that list each game twice with one for each team and remove the column repetition in game_log
* We can also remove the listing for the 9 player position on each team and have a table that tracks the player appearance + position instead 
* We can also just have an individual table for players, umpires and managers instead of having the repeat columns in the game_log
* We can also have a separate table for awards and such instead of having it in game_log 


# STEP 4: Planning a Schema 

While we can very much create a personal schema that connects these various tables together, one schema has been previously provided as shown: 

![here](C:/Users/micha/Documents/MyDatasets/Schema_Baseball_Dataset.JPG).


# STEP 5: Creating Tables Without Foreign Keys 

The first part is to create a new "person" table that consists of (a) person_id set as the primary key, (b) first_name and (c) last_name.  Looking at the information needed for this table, it can be gathered from the person_codes table.  

```{r}

create_person_table_command = "
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS person(
      person_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      first_name TEXT,
      last_name TEXT
  );
"

dbExecute(conn, create_person_table_command)

inserting_data_into_person = "
  INSERT INTO person
  SELECT
    id,
    first,
    last
  FROM person_codes;
"

dbExecute(conn, inserting_data_into_person)

check_query_2 = "SELECT * FROM person LIMIT 5;"

dbGetQuery(conn, check_query_2)

```

The next step is to create a new "park" table that consists of (a) park_id, (b) name, (c) nickname, (d) city, (e) state and (f) notes.  All this information could be gathered from the park_codes table. 

```{r}

create_park_table_command = "
  CREATE TABLE park(
    park_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    nickname TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    state TEXT,
    notes TEXT
  );
"

dbExecute(conn, create_park_table_command)

inserting_data_into_park = "
  INSERT INTO park
  SELECT
    park_id,
    name,
    aka,
    city,
    state,
    notes
  FROM park_codes;
"

dbExecute(conn, inserting_data_into_park)

dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM park LIMIT 5;")

```

The 3rd step is to create the a new "league" table that consists of (a) league_id and (b) name.  All this information needs to be manually inputted because (1) there isn't a league_id column and (2) it's just 6 entries. 

```{r}

create_league_table_command = "
  CREATE TABLE league(
    league_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
  );
"

dbExecute(conn, create_league_table_command)

inserting_data_into_league = '
  INSERT INTO league 
  VALUES
    ("AL", "American League"),
    ("NL", "National League"),
    ("AA", "American Association"),
    ("FL", "Federal League"),
    ("PL", "Players League"),
    ("UA", "Union Association");
'

dbExecute(conn, inserting_data_into_league)

dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM league;") # A check to see if table was properly made

```

The last step is to create the "appearance_type" table.  This table is actually a separate data, found [here](https://dsserver-prod-resources-1.s3.amazonaws.com/376/appearance_type.csv) , that needs to be read and inserted as a table into the data base.  

```{r}

appearance.type = read.csv("appearance_type.csv")

dbWriteTable(conn = conn, name = 'appearance_type', 
             value = appearance.type, row.names = FALSE, header = TRUE)

dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM appearance_type LIMIT 5;") # A check to see if table was properly made

```


# STEP 6: Adding Team + Game Tables

These tables are unique in that they consist of FOREIGN kEYS that link other tables together, namely PARK to GAME (via park_id) and TEAM to LEAGUE (via league_id).  The items to include into the "team" table can be found in the team_codes table.  Alternatively, the "game" table can be found in the game_log table. 

```{r}

create_team_table_command <- "
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS team (
      team_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      league_id TEXT,
      city TEXT,
      nickname TEXT,
      franch_id TEXT,
      FOREIGN KEY (league_id) REFERENCES league(league_id)
  );
"             

dbExecute(conn, create_team_table_command)

inserting_data_into_team_command = "
  INSERT OR IGNORE INTO team
  SELECT
    team_id,
    league,
    city,
    nickname,
    franch_id
  FROM team_codes;
  
"

dbExecute(conn, inserting_data_into_team_command)

dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * FROM team LIMIT 5;")

# Include the "OR IGNORE" term to avoid issue with inserting duplicate entries in other columnns (namely b/t team_id & franch_id).  


create_game_table_command = "
  CREATE TABLE game (
      game_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
      date TEXT,
      number_of_game INTEGER,
      park_id TEXT,
      length_outs INTEGER,
      day BOOLEAN,
      completion TEXT,
      forfeit TEXT,
      protest TEXT,
      attendance INTEGER, 
      length_minutes INTEGER,
      additional_info TEXT,
      acquisition_into TEXT,
      FOREIGN KEY (park_id) REFERENCES park(park_id)
  )
"

dbExecute(conn, create_game_table_command)

inserting_data_into_game = '
  INSERT OR IGNORE INTO game
  SELECT
      game_id,
      date,
      number_of_game,
      park_id,
      length_outs,
      CASE
          WHEN day_night = "D" THEN 1
          WHEN day_night = "N" THEN 0
          ELSE NULL
          END
          AS day,
      completion,
      forefeit,
      protest,
      attendance,
      length_minutes,
      additional_info,
      acquisition_info
  FROM game_log;
'

dbExecute(conn, inserting_data_into_game)

dbGetQuery(conn, 'SELECT * FROM game LIMIT 5;')

```

# STEP 7: Adding the Team Appearance Table

The "team_appearance" table will be made next, which consists of several PRIMARY KEYS (team_id, game_id) along with a FOREIGN KEY (league_id).  The majority of the items found here can be gained from the game_log table.  It is important to note here that inserting home column means that we'll have a boolean column that differentiated between home and visiting teams.  A way to make inserting this data cleanly is to use the UNION clause that combines the home and visiting variables together

```{r}

create_team_appearance_command = "
  CREATE TABLE team_appearance (
    team_id TEXT,
    game_id TEXT,
    home BOOLEAN,
    league_id TEXT,
    score INTEGER,

    FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES game(game_id), 
    FOREIGN KEY (league_id) REFERENCES league(league_id)
  );

dbExecute(conn, create_team_appearance_command)


insert_to_team_appearance = "

  INSERT INTO team_appearance
    SELECT

dbExecute(conn, insert_to_team_appearance)

dbGetQuery(conn, "SELECT * 
                  FROM team_appearance 
                  WHERE league_id = (SELECT league_id FROM game)
                  ORDER BY game_id DESC
                  LIMIT 5;
                  ") 

# CHECK ON THE TABLE

```

# STEP 8: Adding the Person Appearance Table

This table is essentially linking the multiple tables together and is composed on 1 PRIMARY KEY (appearance_id) and 4 FOREIGN KEY (person_id, team_id, game_id and appearance_type_id). This is to be used to cross-regerence with other tables, so we'll need to use a similar technique as with creating the team_appearance but expanded to write one for each column.

This initial step was used to input all the data for non-player individuals (such as umpires, managers, etc.) along with players that had prominent awards or achievements such as winning pitchers or hitters for a particular game.  Obviously, there are more players that will need to be added. This can be done in a similar manner with the above option, but with 36 different permutations (2 for home VS away, 2 for offense VS defense and 9 for each of the 9 positions), there is an easier way. 

The option below use a "for loop" that essentially acts to substitute each %s with a letter (in this case either "h" or "v") to indicate home and visiting team and %f with a number that corresponds to the defensive positioning of said player. 

In the first half of the template, which denotes the OFFENSIVE SIDE OF THINGS, it is essentially inserting 

      (1) game_id with game_id found in game_log, 
      (2) team_id with the team_id differentiated by either Home team or Visiting team differentiator 
      (3) person_id with person_id differentiated by the home vs visiting team identifier AND the corresponding number indicator for field positioning 
      (4) the apearance_type_id differentiated by the numerical indicator for batting line-up 

Similarly, the second half of the template will denote the DEFENSIVE SIDE OF THINGS.  

Finally, using the function "gsub", we will be replacing the %s and %f values with the corresponding letters and numbers
